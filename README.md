API Integration
The application uses the Pixabay API to fetch images. Key API features utilized:
Search Endpoint: Retrieves images based on user queries with parameters like q (query), image_type=photo, per_page, and safesearch.
Featured Images: Randomly selects a category (e.g., nature, technology) to display popular images on the home screen.
Error Handling: Checks for HTTP errors and invalid API responses, displaying user-friendly messages when issues occur.
Note: The API key included in the code is for demonstration purposes. For production, replace it with your own Pixabay API key to avoid rate limits or restrictions.

### Notes:
- **API Key**: The `README.md` advises replacing the hardcoded API key to avoid exposing it in a public repository. Users must sign up at Pixabay to get their own key.
- **Demo Link**: Replace the placeholder `[here](#)` with the actual deployment link if you host the application (e.g., on GitHub Pages or another platform).
- **Your Name/Repository**: Update placeholders like `your-username` and `[Your Name]` with your actual GitHub username and name.
- **License**: The MIT License is assumed, but you can modify it to your preferred license (e.g., Apache, GPL) and include a `LICENSE` file in the repository.
- **Improvements**: If you plan to add features (e.g., image filters, pagination, or additional APIs), you can update the `Features` and `Usage` sections accordingly.

Let me know if you want to customize the `README.md` further or add specific sections!
